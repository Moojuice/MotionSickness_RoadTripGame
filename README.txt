MotionSickness! or RoadTrip Game .py
Created 8/6/14
v 1.0

Synopsis: After self-teaching myself python, I wanted to experiment and utilize my new knowledge in a field that I would enjoy â€” video games! In this simple (for now) project, play as a driver trying to avoid obstacles and survive as long as possible. 

Final idea for the game is to implement a quesey bar that increments the more you drive, the more you move left and right, and if you run into specific obstacles. On the other hand, driving smoothly and picking up helpful drops (like medications or fresh air) would relieve this bar. Perhaps I can add power ups to pick up too, like honk to push all obstacles away? etc etc

Skills: Simple GUI creation, simple graphic creation (ellipses and rectangles, although I include a schematic for a car), timers and clock, pygame utilities and features, sprite creation, sprite animation, game design
